Plan for carcar changes, etc.

- Need to allow Resume menu option to operate
- Need to allow esc, start to quit menu mode (act just like resume)
- Need to define a few world setups, not just one
- Need to decide if we want side scroll from spot to spot or not
	- much easier without so skipping for now
- Collectible animals
	- perhaps as collected they can replace current hero avatar?  cycle key?

Future work:

	- start pos could have gate specific options, although that's not
	  strictly necessary to begin with
	- keys that can be activated in sequence (with and without reset)
	- keys that need to be activated based on timing
