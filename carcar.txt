Plan for carcar changes, etc.

- Joystick start button should count as escape key (e.g., bring up menu)
- Need to fix double new game bug that puts invisible gates in second.wld
- Need to set up basic puzzle mechanic
	- hot zones that both need to be active in order to unlock a door
	- hot zones that can be activated in sequence (with and without reset)
	- hot zones that need to be activated based on timing
	- notion of hot zone state
	- notion of door or lock state
- Need to define a few world setups, not just one
- Need to decide if we want side scroll from spot to spot or not
	- much easier without so skipping for now
- Collectible animals
	- perhaps as collected they can replace current hero avatar?  cycle key?

Future work:

	- start pos could have gate specific options, although that's not
	  strictly necessary to begin with
