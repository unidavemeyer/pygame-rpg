Plan for carcar changes, etc.

- Collectible animals
	- need to stub out Item interface and make Stamp that derives from it (non-stub comes at hero image swap)
	- support movement based on simple patterns in config file
	- may wish to have one to three configurable colors in the image
- Need to define a few world setups, not just one
	- consider making a "city" layout with "houses" to go into
	- consider making a few "houses" with one to three rooms of keys to get through
- Need to make closer-to-real example art
	- wall sections
	- doors
	- floors
	- player characters
	- animals
- Replaceable hero/player character images
	- track animals collected
	- add cycle key to switch how the view looks
	- maybe need controllable background color

Future work:

	- start pos could have gate specific options, although that's not
	  strictly necessary to begin with
	- keys that can be activated in sequence (with and without reset)
	- keys that need to be activated based on timing
	- side scroll from spot to spot
