Plan for carcar changes, etc.

- Need to define a few world setups, not just one
- Collectible animals
	- perhaps as collected they can replace current hero avatar?  cycle key?

Future work:

	- start pos could have gate specific options, although that's not
	  strictly necessary to begin with
	- keys that can be activated in sequence (with and without reset)
	- keys that need to be activated based on timing
	- side scroll from spot to spot
