# pygame-rpg

Purpose
-------

This is a framework/experiment/ongoing project making a basic top-down action
RPG in python using pygame for input/rendering/sound. There are a variety of
ideas that I've had about what to do here in the past, so it is a little bit
on the branchy/messy side since there are lots of different partial bits of
progress that have happened over time.
