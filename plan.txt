Random thoughts:

- should have global object to manage event dispatch, drawing
- should have objects register themselves with the global
- need to have two modes:  walk the world and combat
- lists of updating/event handling/drawing objects should be in
  prioritized lists so that we get the ordering right

- math combat could be fast-as-you-can-go -- each right answer does damage
- math combat could be answer as many in the time -- each right answer incs dmg
- math combat could be chosen per weapon
- punchline for combat is that the weapon should be in charge of events

- random events should always be bounded, and should have a computed/saved
  value for them so that the player could theoretically discover the timing
  of something interesting happening (think semi-rares from KoL)

- level could be layout of index -> image mapping, with a map of indexes
  showing the layout of the level.  Index could also map to passable,
  impassable, damaging, encounter, etc.

- enemies could be surprise or shown (lean towards latter, but may include
  former as well or instead)
