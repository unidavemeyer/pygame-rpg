Random thoughts:

- need enemy object(s)
	- updates based on player/clock/whatever data in map-mode
	- updates damage to player in combat-mode
	- updates health, stats in map-mode based on damage
	- renders position in map-mode
	- renders self, anims in combat-mode
- need weapon object(s)
	- updates combat-mode damage calculations, etc.
	- renders self, maybe, in both modes?
- need combat layout/display object
	- renders combat display (borders, help, etc.)
- need inventory screen
	- handles examination of weapons, other items
	- handles equiping items
	- needs to render to display info
	- needs to handle input when active
	- needs its own mode...?  Maybe sub-mode of WORLDMAP?

- math combat could be fast-as-you-can-go -- each right answer does damage
- math combat could be answer as many in the time -- each right answer incs dmg
- math combat could be chosen per weapon
- punchline for combat is that the weapon should be in charge of events

- random events should always be bounded, and should have a computed/saved
  value for them so that the player could theoretically discover the timing
  of something interesting happening (think semi-rares from KoL)

- level could be layout of index -> image mapping, with a map of indexes
  showing the layout of the level.  Index could also map to passable,
  impassable, damaging, encounter, etc.

- enemies could be surprise or shown (lean towards latter, but may include
  former as well or instead)

- Maybe crafting mechanic produces random or pseudo-random item, but combines
  all bonuses from both input items.  Difficulty then based on total number
  of points of bonuses, perhaps.

- Maybe we don't bother to track xp -- character levels up by improving
  equipment?  Seems like it might make sense -- cap things based on the player's
  skill somehow rather than the arbitrary limits of xp...

- Should we do everything as dynamic difficulty somehow?  Arrange it so that
  the player always feels like they're strong enough for basic challenges,
  but barely make it past bosses, etc.?  How do we manage information like that?
  Make it so that defeats decrement the difficulty?  Make it so that we track
  how fast the player defeats opponents and ramp the difficulty up so that they
  get fairly wounded?  Track player damage vs. opponent damage?  Arrange so that
  the farther ahead the opponent gets, the worse they get?  With some rate or limit
  so that you can really be up against something too hard?  How do we modify?  Treat
  weapon damage modifiers as the key to opening up new areas?  Hmmm....
