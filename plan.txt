Random thoughts:

- need to have two modes:  walk the world and combat
	- actually, may also want transition in/out, main menu, pause menu;
	  seems like we should make this a state machine of some kind with
	  transitions and the like
- need world/level/room object(s)
	- renders static level geometry
	- handles "hot zones" (i.e., doors, etc.)
- need combat layout/display object
	- renders combat display (borders, help, etc.)
- need hero object
	- handles map-mode input
	- updates position of player in map mode, based on input
	- updates stats of player in combat mode, based on damage, xp, etc.
	- renders self in map-mode, combat-mode
- need weapon object(s)
	- handles combat-mode input
	- updates combat-mode damage calculations, etc.
	- renders questions/answers/progress for attack in combat mode
	- renders self, maybe, in both modes?
- need enemy object(s)
	- updates based on player/clock/whatever data in map-mode
	- updates damage to player in combat-mode
	- updates health, stats in map-mode based on damage
	- renders position in map-mode
	- renders self, anims in combat-mode

- math combat could be fast-as-you-can-go -- each right answer does damage
- math combat could be answer as many in the time -- each right answer incs dmg
- math combat could be chosen per weapon
- punchline for combat is that the weapon should be in charge of events

- random events should always be bounded, and should have a computed/saved
  value for them so that the player could theoretically discover the timing
  of something interesting happening (think semi-rares from KoL)

- level could be layout of index -> image mapping, with a map of indexes
  showing the layout of the level.  Index could also map to passable,
  impassable, damaging, encounter, etc.

- enemies could be surprise or shown (lean towards latter, but may include
  former as well or instead)
